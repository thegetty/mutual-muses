      Dearest Sylvia
      The first words I want to say are - I love you - and that you have been in my thoughts ever since you left yesterday. Now I shall recite, as you wished, my news, in the order it happened.
      CJ & I went to the Worrans International: good pictures (4) by Celia, an interesting Ithell Calquhoun, James Hodgkins' east picture, 3 drawings by Madeleine Pearson, and then a mass of paintings which made me long for the [unclear]memories[/unclear] of your pictures on the wall, showing what a woman painter is capable of.
      Mother's birthday is tomorrow so my telegram was 5 days early. I pleaded 'overwork' ( and have just bought her present, as part of it, 4 Chanel No5 tablets). She wore her evening gown to show me, she is going to [unclear]aratha[/unclear] dance on Tuesday, and her cabbage rose which is huge, beautifully made, is a divine purple & blue mass of shiftery tints. Her dress is  'hyacinth blue' and of moire taffeta.  The neck  item - and at her waist a lozenge-shaped diamante clip.
      I stayed all night, collected some Joyce articles in  comics, & departed this morning with half a pound of butter.
      Miss Chick was friendly & I have decided to collect the reproductions myself; for which Miss Chick will see I am
