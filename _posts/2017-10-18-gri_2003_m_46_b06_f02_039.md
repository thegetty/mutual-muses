      [16-2-53] Dearest Sylvia,

      I am surrounded by books and papers and notes but as my typewriter is out and I keep thinking of you I must just stop work for a few minutes and write to you.   I hope that you are really rested now, that the good night you mentioned in a recent letter has not been isolated, and, also, that you are not worried about your show.  I am sure it will be a success and I am looking forward to it very much indeed.  Once it has started I am sure that you will be happy, too.

      I have written to Gabriel White to see if he will let me do some Mexican lectures:  it is not in the hands of Mary Chamot.  White will have to consult with the Mexicans, I believe, who are being very exact and careful about everything connected with their exh.  No casual Spanish exuberance, it seems.

      I hope you do not mind that Pasmore may be here on Thursday morning but he is going away for a bit and then I am, and it was one of the few chances to see him, and I need to see him for the article.  Questions to ask and so on.  (If you can possibly lend me 1 on Thursday, by the way, it will be gratefully received.  As usual I am waiting for cheques but I do not expect anything until Friday, when I think Banstead Art Group will pay cash.)

      At present I am writing about films (something called "groupthink'), art and the machine, Pasmore, and get-ting a Constable lecture ready.  Poems are coming in bits and pieces, too.  (I rather wish no-one was com-ing this evening for I am working well and would not mind going on till bedtime.)

      The new Burlington is interesting.  Have you had a chance to look over the articles on the Dutch exh.?  As Robert said:  it is a waste of money to buy the catalogue, there are so many errors of attribution.

      Only 8 rooms apart from Matisse at the T.C. are open at the moment so I shall have to get new lectures ready, I think, for Thurs-day and Saturday.  Tomorrow (Constable) is all right, fortunately.  Many of the upstairs galleries are being used for storage as the basements could be flooded any time until 27th.  After that it is safe I think.

      Now, darling, I shall go and post this.  I do love, love, love, you:  do not forget.  I adore you, Lawrence

      Dearest Sylvia,
      I am surrunded by books and papers and notes but as my typewriter is out and I keep thinking of you I must just stop work for a few minutes and write to you. I hope that you are really rested now, that the good night you mentioned in a recent letter has not been isolated, and, also, that you are not worried about your show. I am sure it will be a success and I am looking forward to it very much indeed. Once it has started I am sure that you will be happy too.
      I have written to Gebriel White to see if he will let me do some Mexican lectures: it is not in the hands of Mary Chamot. White will have to consult with the Mexicans, I believe, who are being very exact and careful about everything connected with their exh. No casual Spanish exuberance, it seems.
      I hope you do not mind that Pasmore may be here on Thursday morning but he is going awa< for a bit and then I am, and it was one of the few chaces to see him, and I need to see him for the article. Questions to ask and so on. (If you can possibly lend me $1 on Thursday, by the way, it wil be greatefully received. As usual I am waiting for cheques but I do not expect anything until Friday, when I think Banstead Art Group will pay cash.)
      At present I am writing about films (something called 'groupthink'), art and the machine, Pasmore, and getting a Constable lecture ready. Poems are coming in bits and pieces, too. (I rather wish no-one was coming this evening for I am working well and would not mind going on till bedtime.)
      The new Burlington is interesting. Have you had a chance to look over the articles on the Dutch exh.? As Robert said: it is a waste of money to buy the catalogue, there are so many errors of attribution.
      Only 8 rooms apart from Matisse at the T.G. are open at the moment so I shall have to get new lectures ready, I think, for Thursday and Saturday. Tomorrow (Constable) is all right, fortunately. Many of the upstairs gelleries are being used for storage as the basement could be flooded any time until 27th. After that it is safe I think.
      Now darling, I shall go and post this. I do love, love, love you: do not forget. I adore you,
      Lawrence
