      12 v '53 Blackheath Dearest Sylvia
      I love the look of your painting from your sketch. As you say -
      my kind of composition. That, combined with your kind of color, will
      produce a really splendid picture. How busy you are, with
      the watercolor and the nude going at the same time.

      How busy you are socially, too. Your time-table for Satur-
      day is terrific. Did you enjoy 'Venice Preserv'd? But I'm
      sure you did. I must say I envy you seeing that.

      I am glad - though not really surprised - that your father
      liked the mustard rat. He couldn't fail to, it is so nice.
      He seems to have responded very gallantly to your birth-day. Tell me, when you untied the fine bow - were there
      chocolates inside as you suspected...

      Give Beryl my love - and how did she like The Red Badge?

      I have been working hard, writing and interviewing sculptors.
      I have seen Adams again (to get photgraphs) and, also,
      Geoffrey Clarke. Tomorrow night I have a chance to
      meet Kenneth Armitage who will be in town then: I have
      laboriously uncovered his moments. Clarke said
      I might like to see his thesis for ARCA: so I went to
      the college expecting a few typewriter pages, only to be con-
      fronted with a great volume measuring about 24x18 -
      & thick. I have it here now... Sending photographs
      animal to the states is expensive. It has already
      cost me 1. 10s. 90.

      Blackheath
      Dearest Sylvia
      I love the look of your painting from your sketch. As you say - my kind of composition. That, combined with your kind of colour, will produce a really splendid picture. How busy you are, with the watercolour and the nude going at the same time.
      How busy you are socially, too. Your time-table for Saturday is terrific. Did you enjoy 'Venice Preserved'? But I'm sure you did. I must say I envy you seeing that.
      I am glad - though not really surprised - that your father liked the mustard pot. He couldn't fail to, it is so nice. He seems to have responded very gallantly to your birthday. Tell me, when you untied the fine bow - were there chocolates inside as you suspected....
      Give Beryl my love - and how did she like The Red Badge?
      I have been working hard, writing and interviewing sculptors. I have seen Adams again (to get photographs) and, also, Geoffrey Clarke. Tomorrow night I have a chance to meet Kenneth Armitage who will be in town then: I have laboriously uncovered his movements. Clarke said I might like to see his thesis for ARCA: so I went to the college expecting a few typewritten pages, only to be confronted with a great volume measuring about 24 x 18 & thick. I have it here now..... Sending photographs airmail to the states is ecxpensive. It has already cost me 1 pound 10 shillings and 9 pence.
