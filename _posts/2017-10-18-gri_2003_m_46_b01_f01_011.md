      The watering can
      And girls' legs under tables
      In out-door cafés
      Crossed obtrusive banners
      On the fourteenth of July

      How will she read them
      Will the shutters' cage
      Shadow them Her hands
      Be gloved Be dressed
      For walking Or nude
      But for a comb or ribbon or shoe

      Take my poem as the equivalent of Manet's drawings and perhaps the identification won't seem too presumptuous. The real point is in the last six lines, in my curiosity about the reader of the letter. And a small poem, again, rather French: Pour S...

      Girl with a boat sailing her hair
      Girl with reason on her side
      Girl with the manner I adore
      She wears a red cloak
      It is not a disguise
      Her roses her answers
      Her silhouettes her crimes
      Nude from the head down

      Her breasts are built over my heart.

      One of the things I've tried to do in the poems 'about you for you' is to exclude complete understanding by another reader by using certain images that mean more to us than anyone else: thus there is a deliberate privacy at one or two points in the sequence. Here you alone will recognise the full reference. To me this means shared authorship in the poems, beyond being their subject.

      Your-heart-in-me assures me that yesterday's moods of sadness have not been fatal. My-heart-in-you will tell you that my perplexity, I suppose my obtuseness, does not conflict with my adoration.

      I live for Wednesday. St. Pancras is no longer my favorite terminal station. Victoria replaces it. Morning and night at 11,3 (not less prompt than your train itself in arriving) the same image occurs to me. I have just seen you at the iron gate among the anonymous extras. I love you.

      The watering can
      And girls' legs under tables
      In out-door cafes
      Crossed obtrusive banners
      On the fourteenth of July

      How will she read them
      Will the shutters' cage
      Shadow them Her hands
      Be gloved Be dressed
      For walking Or nude
      But for a somb or ribbon or shoe

      Take my poem as the equivalent of manet's drawings and perhaps
      the identification won't seem too presumptious. The real point is in the last six lines, in my curiosity about the reader of the letter. And a small poem, again rather French: Pour S. . .

      Girl with a boat sailing her hair
      Girl with reason on her side
      Girl with the manner I adore
      She wears a red cloak
      It is not a disguise
      Her roses her answers
      Her silhouettes her crimes
      Nude from the head down

      Her breasts are built over my heart.

      One of the things I've tried to do in the poems 'about you for you' is to exclude complete understanding by another reader by using certain images that mean more to us than anyone else: thus there is a deliberate privacy at one or two points in the sequence. Here you alone will recognise the full reference. To me this means shared authorship in the poems, beyond their subject.

      Your-heart-in-me assures me that yesterday's seeds of sadness have not been fatal. My-heart-in-you will tell you that my perplexity, I suppose my obtuseness, does not conflict with my adoration.

      I live for Wednesday. St. Pancras is no longer my favorite terminal station. Victoria replaces it. Morning and night at 11.3 (not less prompt than your train itself in arriving) the same image occurs to me. I have just seen you at the iron gate among anonymous extras. I love you.
