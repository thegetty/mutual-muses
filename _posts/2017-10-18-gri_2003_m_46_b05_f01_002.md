      the week before had 25 or so, on the other hand. The numbers ought to go up
      a bit for Blake this afternoon I should think.\nYour account of gardening has
      a delightful open air tang about it - your very phrases are confident and bracing.
      You do seem to have been uncommonly strenuous and creative in the open. Lion
      feels rather '[unclear]effunet[/unclear]' of compassion. I am sure it is good

      T.G. 3.1.52
      Dearest Sylvia
      Forgive me, but there was very little time to contact Wendy [unclear]Korp.[/unclear] And, as you know, I am but slightly acquainted with her.
      My regency lecture was very poorly attended: three! Sculpture, the week before had 25 or so, on the other hand. The numbers aught to go up a bit for Blake this afternoon I should think.
      Your account of gardening has a delightful open air tang about it - your very phrases are confident and bracing. You do seem to have been uncommonly strenuous and creative in the open. Lion feels rather [unclear]'effunct'[/unclear] in comparison. I am sure it is good for you - provided you care for your hands. I do wish I had been there to help you.
      The rose and the popinjay story pleases me very much. Yes I might be able to write a poem about it. I will attempt it when I have a free moment. Thank you for narrating the exquisite fable. I would like to be able to do justice to it if I can.
      News of Cocteau's Bacchus thrills me. I do look forward to hearing in a future letter something of the plot and Cocteau's treatment.
      I wonder if you would help Lion in the following way. The WEA have not yet paid me for Banstead but I ought to pay Mrs Harrison the 2 months rent I owe her. I have been waiting for the WEA cheque. Could you possibly write me a cheque for the amount which I will pay into my account and write Mrs H my own cheque. Then immediately the Banstead cheque comes I will endorse it and send it to you. You need feel no anxiety. Your money will be entirely safe but I do not want to delay paying Mrs H any longer. The sum is 23 pounds. It will be back in your account within a week or so, I promise. Father is a bit worried about money at the moment so I would like not to ask him this time. Please help your Lion - it is only for a short time and you will soon have the WEA cheque to pay into your own account.
      Here is a short poem for my Muse:

      The sleep of blondes is full of dark
      Heads of waking women; the sleep
      Of men is full of atlases
      Of female countries.
