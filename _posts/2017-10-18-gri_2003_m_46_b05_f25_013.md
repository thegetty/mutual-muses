      Blackheath
      Sunday
      Dearest Sylvia
      The weater hesitates between sunny and grey:  what will it
      do, I wonder?  IF possible I shall work in the garden, but
      probably it is too windy.  I notice clouds increasing, too.
      The lectures I have to get ready for this week will take all
      day--and more, so I shall make a start on them after this
      letter is posted.
      Have you heard anything from Britania and Eve yet?  I saw
      Iris, for a drink, the other evening and she asked after the
      final details of yor show.  Andre is having some heart
      trouble it seems, at the moment:  he must not get excited
      but cannot stop from becoming excited, and 'palpitations'
      result.
      Speaking of illness, poor Monica (at the Tate) has not been
      well for a long time, as you know.  It seems that, at pre-
      sent, she is suffering with a period which, instead of com-
      ing once a month, has lasted for over a month.  Her doctor
      seems unable to stop it.
      The dentist may be able to finish me in one more visit:
      anyway, two will certianly see it finished.  Did I tell
      you I was early to my last appointment:  early to the den-
      tist.  There's a name for people who make that mistake.
      Winter Odalisque is so nice a name for your life painting.
      Asn your other paintings, what of thm?  I want not to
      miss any piece of news, however small, about them.
      Here are pieces of my new poems.  Not quite complete but
      on the way:
      CARYATIDS
      Locked where they are they make a world
      of being forbidden, slow time

      now the house is a basket on each head.

      Blackheath

      Sunday

      Dearest Sylvia

      The weather hesitates between sunny and grey: what will it
      do, I wonder? If possible I shall work in the garden, but
      probably it is too windy. I notice clouds increasing, too.
      The lectures I have to get ready for this week will take all
      day - and ore, so I shall make a start on them after this
      letter is posted.

      Have you heard anything from Britania and Eve yet? I saw
      Iris, for a drink, the other evening and she asked after the
      final details of your show. Andre is having some heart
      trouble it seems, at the moment: he must not get excited
      but cannot stop from becoming excited, and 'palpitations'
      result.

      Speaking of illness, poor Monica (at the Tate) has not been
      well for a long time, as you know. It seems that, at pre-
      sent, she is suffering with a period which, instead of com-
      ing once a month, has lasted for over a month. Her doctor
      seems unable to stop it.

      The dentist may be able to finish me in one more visit:
      anyway, two will certainly see it finished. Did I tell
      you I was early to my last appointment: early to the den-
      tist. There's a name for people who makes that mistake.

      Winter Odalisque is so nice a name for your life painting.
      And your other paintings, what of them? I want not to
      miss any piece of news, however small, about them.

      Here are pieces of my new poems. Not quite complete but
      on the way:

      CARYATIDS

      Locked where they are they make a world
      of being forbidden, slow time
      took off the guilty hand, right and left:
      now the house is a basket on each head.

      Proud as marble, they cannot reach
      their own body, like another's,
      hannting and alien at the touch;
      stric example to our extra limbs
      which carry and send me.

      Look Ma, no hands.
