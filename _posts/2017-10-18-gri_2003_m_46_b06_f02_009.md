      In the train
      3 11 1953
      My dearest Sylvia
      Thank you for your letters. I am so sorry that you have caught my cold but at least you are staying in bed so I hope you will recover quickly.
      Those Woods, really. What kind of people are they? Charming, loving, generous when I am there but full of negative criticism when I am gone. It adds to your worry, I fear. They read too much fiction - always improvising brilliant drama - remember Desiree's 'breakdown' (whatever happened to that 'breakdown' anyway?). Do not worry. I am seeing Le Roux S le Roux today about Cardiff as the 12th is the deadline, remember.
      I am as pleased you have painted more of your self-portrait and glad, too, that before you went to bed you did some framing. I know I have not always liked your every frame in the past but I do think you manage framing excellently now.
      I am on my way to the T. G. for the Turner lecture and to fix up lecturing dates in March.

      In the train
      3 11 1953

      My dearest Sylvia,

      Thank you for your letters. I am so sorry that you have caught my cold but at least you are staying in bed so I hope you will recover quickly.
      Those Woods, really. What kind of people are they? Charming. loving, generous when I am there but full of negative criticism when I am gone. It adds to your worry, I fear. They need too much fiction- always [unclear][/unclear] brilliant [unclear][/unclear]- remember Desiree's 'breakdown' (whatever happened to that 'breakdown' anyway?). Do not worry. I am seeing [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] today about Cardiff [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] 12th is the deadline, remember.
      I am so pleased you have painted more of your self-portraits and glad, too, that before you went to bed you did some framing. I know I have not always liked your every frame in the past but I do think that you manage framing excellently now.
      I am on my way to the T.S. for the Turner lecture and to fix up lecturing dates in March.
