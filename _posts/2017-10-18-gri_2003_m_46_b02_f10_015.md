      At the National Gallery      Friday
      Dearest Sylvia,
           I wish that this were a longer letter but today I am so busy.   This morning I arranged and hung the Van Gogh-reproductions exhibition at the Hammersmith (in-cluding the screens) in four hours.   Then at two I had a school lecture at the N.G. This has just finished and I have just been able to eat something at last since breakfast.   That means I have [unclear]larned[/unclear] ones 3 today, which is a good thing though I am rather tired.   Paul is taking me out this evening - I think to see Les Amants de Verone.
           I am going to give my last lectures to the Banstead people this Saturday (tomorrow) at the N.G. (The [unclear]cleared[/unclear] Aristo is on view at last.)   I hope your lecture to-night goes very well, sweet Minerva, eloquent representative of the arts!   I imagine that your owls are busy on research for you.   By the way I hope to get onto [unclear]a[/unclear] Central Committee of the A.I.A. at a meet-ing tomorrow afternoon.   I will let you know if I do.
           Allens enquired after you - you may be pleased to hear, or you may not - however, he did.
           I shall write you a vast letter on Sunday.
                 I love you Lawrence

      At the National Gallery Friday [25-11-49]

      Dearest Sylvia

      I wish that this were a longer letter but today I am so busy. This morning I arranged and hung and the Van Gogh-reproductions exhibition at Hammersmith (including the screens) in four hours. Then at two I had a school lecture at the N.G. This has just finished and I have just been able to eat something at last since breakfast. That means I have earned over 3 today which is a good thing though I am rather tired. Paul is taking me out this evening - I think to see Les Amants de Verons.

      I am going to give my last lecture to the Banstead people this Saturday (tomorrow) at the N.G. (The cleaned Aristo is on view at last.) I hope your lecture to-night goes very well, sweet Minerva, eloquent representative of the arts! I imagine that your owls are busy on research for you. By the way I hope to get onto the central committee of the A.I.A. at a meeting tomorrow afternoon. I will let you know if I do.

      Albert enquired after you - you may be pleased to hear, or you may not - however, he did.

      I shall write you a vast letter on Sunday.

      I love you

      Lawrence

      Friday [25-11-49]
      At the National Gallery
      Dearest Sylvia
      I wish that this were a longer letter but today I am so busy. This morning I arranged and hung the Van Gogh-reproductions exhibition at [unclear]Htemmesmith[/unclear] (in-
      cluding the screens) in four hours. Then at two I had a school lecture at the N.G. This has just finished and I have just been able to eat something at last since breakfast. That means I have earned over 3 today which is a good thing though I am rather tired. Paul is taking me out this evening - I think to see Les Amants de Verone.
      I am going to give my last lecture to the Bandero people this Saturday (tomorrow) at the N.G. (The cleared Ariosto in on view at last.)  I hope your lecture to-
      night goes very well, sweet Minerva, eloquent representative of the arts! I imagine that your owls are busy on research for you. By the way I hope to get onto the Central Committee at the A.I.A at a meet-
      ing tomorrow afternoon. I will let you know if I do.
      Albert enquired after you - you may be pleased to hear, or you may not - however, he did.
      I shall write you a [unclear]vast[/unclear] letter on Sunday
      I love you
      Lawrence
