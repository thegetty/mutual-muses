            Thank you for your foot measurement. I will get the sandal tomorrow. I am in town already now (9.15) as I have to put in a day at the S.E.A. I intend to ask Mrs [unclear] for my  £13 which is needed for the rent. You will be glad to hear that proofs have started coming in for the Popular Art number.
           Oh by the way a woman wrote to me as Editor saying she liked Clifford's article. She said  'what about The Road to Xanadu as a study  of the  ucs creative process'. I thought I wouldn't bother Clifford with it so I wrote back saying I know mr Wood was familiar with the work & that it was about, not the ucs, but the pre-conscious.
           Thank you for your news about Devier- I'm sure you cheered her up, sad as she was.
           I will write a little later on today I expect with news about my next visit.
           How I adore you. I love you so much.
                       I love you
                          Lawrence

      Thank you for your foot measurement.
      I will get the sandal tomorrow.  I am in town
      already now (9:15) as I have to put in a
      day at the S.E.A.  I intend to [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear]
      for my 13 which is needed for the rent.  You
      will be glad to hear that proofs have started
      coming in for the [unclear][/unclear]art number.
      Oh by the way a woman wrote to me as
      Editor saying she liked Clifford's article.
      She said "what about The Road to [unclear]Xaradu[/unclear]"  as a study of the [unclear][/unclear] creative [unclear][/unclear]?  I
      thought I wouldn't bother Clifford with it
      so I wrote back saying [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] Mr Wood
      was familiar with the work [unclear][/unclear][unclear][/unclear] it was
      about, not the [unclear][/unclear], but the pre-concious.
      Thank you for your news about Desire'e.
      I'm sure you cheered her up, sad as she was.
      I will write a little later on today I ex-
      pect with news about my next visit.
      How I adore you.  I love you so
      much
      I love you
      Lawrence
