      Blackheath 12 xi 1950

      Dearest Sylvia,

      I do hope that your journey on Friday was not unbearable and that you were not expected to stay at the Greenwoods longer than a day. I hope you are back in Pett today and I wonder if you have kept your resolve about NOT going to the Remembrance service... I heard some maroons (?) at 11.00 so Yawolla and Hetty danced vigorously for two minutes until Hetty fell exhausted with her hair all over the place.

      If only you had stayed on we should have been alright for B'ham have paid me for the Renoir. Increasingly I believe that hedonism is the only possible attitude. Every time I admit the necessity of planning ahead, bearing in mind future situations, something happens to show I could have had my cake and eaten it. Would, my dearest sweetheart, my love, that you had stayed. Look after the present and the future looks after you too, is the motto Hetty has painted round Yawolla's new cowboy hat.

      So with the cheque, I went to Ted's: then I went to the N. G. and discovered some exciting new details in the Bronzino; read Martin Davies' book on Leonardo for next Saturday's lecture (Charles let me use his coffin); raced to the V & A, looked up a book on Bronzino. I have almost finished the Bronzino now and as I am taking a carbon copy I will send it to you in my next letter.

      A bird has just been eating some berries on the holly tree for lunch. For mine I finished, apart from other courses, your delicious apple sweet. Thank you again for making it.

      The right slides, almost, have come from the V & A and I must say I am glad to have the B'ham £6 so that I shall not be travelling without a penny to spare as I had expected to do. Also I have paid the milkman whose horse was getting impatient. And, I shall definitely be able to get to Norwich now.

      By the way, see if you can guess, before my article comes, what the basic situation in the Bronzino is, or, at any rate, what my guess at it is. Partly I amplify Panovsky's manifest symbols, partly not.

      Dearest Sylvia, I adore you: you made me so happy by coming here last week. I hope we shall meet again very soon.
      I love you

      Every time I admit the necessity of planning ahead, bearing in mind future situations,
      something happens to show I could have had my cake and eaten it. Would, my dearest
      sweetheart, my love, that you had stayed. Look after the present and the future
      looks after you too, is the motto Hetty has painted round Yawolla''s new cowboy
      hat.<br/><br/>     So, with the cheque, I went to Ted''s:  then I went to the
      N. G. and discovered some exciting new details in the Bronzino: read Martin
      Davies'' book on Leonardo for next Saturday''s lecture (Charles let me use his
      coffin) raced to the V & A, looked up a book on Bronzino. I have almost finished
      the Bronzino now and as I am taking a carbon copy I will send it to you in my
      next letter.<br/><br/>     A bird has just been eating some berries on the holly
      tree for lunch. For mine I finished, apart from other courses, your delicious
      apple sweet. Thank you again for making it.<br/><br/>     The right slides,
      almost, have come from the V & A and I must say I am glad to have the B''ham  6
      so that I shall not be traveling without a penny to spare as I had expected
      to do. Also I have paid the milkman whose horse was getting impatient. And,
      I shall definitely be able to get to Norwich now.<br/><br/>     By the way,
      see if you can guess, before my article comes, what the basic situation in the
      Bronzino is, or, at any rate, what my guess at it is. Partly I amplify Panovsky''s
      manifest symbols, partly not.<br/>  <br/>     Dearest Sylvia, I adore you: you
      made me so happy by coming here last week. I hope we shall meet again very soon.<br/><br/>                       I
      love you<br/>                          Lawrence'
