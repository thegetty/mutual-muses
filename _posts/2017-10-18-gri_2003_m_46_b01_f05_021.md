      III
      I am, as you recommend, working to-
      wards [unclear]morning[/unclear] from this address. My first move is to live on two pounds a week for this quarter and this to start September until my full ₤50. Perhaps I will do some lectures at this time and [unclear]that[/unclear] way be enough to finance a move. We'll see.
      Are you sure Solomon's trouble sounds like 'Prostrate'. [unclear]Surely that makes reten-
      tion of urine.[/unclear] This is quite the reverse I'm sure he'll be alright for Italy; he feels so himself since he is planning it. You can be sure this is sufficient guarantee of con-
      tinuing health.
      Here is the [unclear]section[/unclear]of an Elizabethan sonnet by somebody known only as E.B.
      And when the Sun-shine which dissolv'd the snow,
      Cullourd the bubble with a pleasant relie,
      And made the rathe and timely Primrose grow,
      Swarth clowdes with-drawne (which longer time doth tarie)
      Oh what is praise, pompe, glory, joy, but so
      As shine by fountains, bubbles, flowers or snow?
      The images are sad but [unclear]have[/unclear]the bubble's relie themselves. It is quoted from a collection I have of Tudor Sonnets in original spellings. I read it frequently, with, needless to say, you in mind. Andd her is a line [unclear]S D Rayton:[/unclear]
      I gave my fairth to love, love his to mee,
      That hee and I, sworne brothers should remaine

      I am, as you recommended, working towards moving from this address. My first move is to love on two pounds a week for this quarter and then to start September with my full £50. Perhaps I will do some lectures at this time and this may be enough to finance a move. We'll see.

      Are you sure Solomon's trouble sounds like 'prostrate'. Usually that involves retention of urine. This is quite the [unclear]serene[/unclear]. I'm sure he'll be alright for Italy; he feels so himself since he is planning it. You can be sure this is sufficient guarantee of continuing health.

      Here is the sestet of an Elizabethan sonnet by somebody known only as E.B.

      And when the sun-shine which dissolv'd the snow,
      [unclear]culloured[/unclear] the bubble with a pleasant rane,
      And made the [unclear]rathe[/unclear] and lonely primrose grow,

      as [unclear]weat[/unclear] is praise, pompe, glory, day, but so
      As sine by fountaines, bubbles, [unclear]jealous[/unclear] as now?

      The images are sad but have the bubble's rane themselves. It is quoted from a collection I have of Tudor sonnets in original spelling. I read it frequently, with, needless to say, you in mind. And here is a [unclear]line 50 ???[/unclear]
