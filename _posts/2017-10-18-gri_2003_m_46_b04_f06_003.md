      By the way, here is a picture of
      1951 Dandy to show Marjorie:

      I am so sorry not to have re-
      membered - but I expect you
      will be fairly busy until I
      come - to give you your easel
      and painting box.  There are
      always large watercolours if
      you get an opportunity to
      paint.

      It is time your lion went to bed - I
      mean, retire:  he is still a bit Victorian.
      I love you: good night, my beauty.

      24 vi.
      I am about to go out to ring Ithell.  I am
      glad to see that the weather is pleasant
      again so I expect it will be delightful
      in the country.  I wish I were with you.

      I love you so dearly, my muse, my dancer,
      I adore you
      Lawrence

      I am so sorry not to have re-
      membered - but I expect you
      will be fairly busy until I
      come - to give you your easel
      and painting box. There are
      always large watercolours if
      you get an opportunity to
      paint.
      It is time your lion went to bed - I
      mean retired: he is still a bit Victorian.
      I love you: good night, my beauty.

      I am about to go out or ring Ithell. I am
      glad to see that the weather is pleasant
      again so I expect it will be delightful
      in the country. I wish I were with you.
      I love you so dearly, my muse, my dancer,
      I adore you
      Lawrence
