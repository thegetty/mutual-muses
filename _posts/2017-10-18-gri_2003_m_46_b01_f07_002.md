      Monday. August the Second.

      Dear Sylvia,

      Thank you so much for your letter. You really
      should not apologise for it because you evoked very vividly the places you had seen, especially the landscapes. And, of course, the Pitti interiors which sound ravishing: I suppose the Adam-like decoration comes from the Raphaelesque Grotesque based on Roman work. And, oh, Pietro da Cortona ceilings... Well, you can imagine how I feel about them! Are they not too hot in color: I expect color is the weakest point. How I look forward to seeing them one day...

      The landscapes you write of put me in mind of the best Corots. I am glad you stressed that part of Italy in your letters because it suggested to me some lines in a poem I am writing. I had been stuck. Then your letter came and the obstruction was removed. (The poems are at the end of the letter.) You seem to be enjoying sculpture very much: it is almost impossible to see anything in England of course. Now that you have seen the two early Giorginne's I would be interested to have your opinion of the Hampton Court one. Is it alright do you think still?

      San Miniato sounds a delight. The familiar words with, alas, only literary associations ring in my mind. ...Arno... Rosselino... Baldovinetti;;. all assembling a picture of fabulous pleasures to me and of actual experience to you. The facade is ravishing from what you say.

      Thank you for the address which take me up to the 14th. you should have found two letters at Siena: did you? And three at Florence. I make the point because you imply a criticism of my writing. Perhaps I imagine it. No, re-reading I think it is there. How was the Palazzo at Siena; as grand as it sounds? Is food and accomodation very expensive. Albert and John, by the way, are in Italy by now - concentrating, I think, on Venice.

      I have had no news (despite promises) of the room at East Sheen so I suppose I shall have to start looking elsewhere soon. I met John Skipp the other day. I do not like him very much but we talked all afternoon and that is a good sign. There is a good chance, now, of occasional work with travelling exhibitions: £10 a week, with extra for expenses and other matters. An admirable rate is it not.

      The landscapes you write of put me in mind of the best Corots.  I am glad you stressed that part of Italy in your letter because it suggested to me some lines in a poem I was writing.  I had been stuck.  Then your letter came and the obstru-ction was removed.  (The poems are at the end of the letter.)  You seem to be enjoying sculpture very much:  it is almost impossible to see anything in England of course.  Now that you have seen the two early Giorgione's I would be interested to have your opinion of the Hampton Court one.  Is it al-right do you think still?

      San Miniato sounds a delight.  The familiar words with, alas, only literary associations ring in my mind.  ...Arne...  Rosselino...  Baldovinette... all assembling a picture of fabulous pleasure to me and of actual experience to you.  The facade is ravishing from what you say.

      Thank you for the address which take me up to the 14th.  You should have found two letters at Siena:  did you?  And three at Florence.  I make the point because you imply a criticism of my writ-ing.  Perhaps I imagine it.  No, re-reading I think it is there.  How as the Palazzo at Siena;  as grand as it sounds?

      you so much for your letter. You really should not apologize for it because
      you evoked very vividly the places you had seen, especially the landscapes.

      decoration comes from the Raphaelesque Grotesque based on Roman work? And, oh,

      Then your letter came and the obstruction was removed. (The poems are at the

      impossible to see anything in England of course. Now that you have seen the

      have found two letters at Siena: did you? And three at Florence. I make the

          Thank you so much for your letter.  You really should not apologise for it because you evoked very vividly the places you had seen, especially the landscapes.  And, of course, the Pitti interiors which sound ravishing:  I suppose the Adam-like decoration comes from the Raphaelesque Grotesque based on Roman work?  And, oh, Pietro de Cortana ceilings . . .  Well, you can imagine how I feel about them!  Are they not too hot in color:  I expect color is the weakest point,  How I look forward to seeing them one day . . .

          The landscapes you write of put me in mind of the best Corots.  I am glad you stressed that aprt of Italy in your letter came and the obstruction was removed.  (The poems are at the end of the letter.)  You seem to be enjoying sculpture very much:  it is almost impossible to see anything in England of course.  Now that you have seen the  two early Giorgione's I would be interested to have your opinion of the Hampton Court one.  Is it alright do you think still?

          San Miniato sounds a delight.  The familiar words with, alas, only literary associations ring in my mind.  . . . Arno . . .    Rosselino. . .  Baldovinetti . . . all assembling a picture of fabulous pleasures to me and of actual experience to you.  The facade is ravishing from what you say.

          Thank you for the address which take me up to the 14th.  You should have found two letters at Sienna:  did you?  And three at Florence.  I make the point because you imply a criticism of my writing.  Perhaps I imagine it.  No, re-reading I think it is there.  How was the Palazzo at Sienna;  as grand as it sounds?

           I have had no news (despite promises) of the room at East Sheen so I suppose I shall have to start looking elsewhere soon.  I met John Skipp the other day.  I do not like him very much but we talked all afternoon and that if a good sign.  There is a good chance, now, of occasional work with travelling exhibitions:  10 pounds a week, with extra for expenses and other matters.  An admirable rate it is not.
